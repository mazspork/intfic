			object LITTERATURE within PLAYER error MSG74
		actions
			message From experiences with forestation in equatorial countries, it is successfully proven that substantially fewer trees can survive on the same land mass as compared to sub-tropic and non-equatorial areas. Thus, for maximum growth, trees should be wider scattered and have a lower frecuency per square unit. See also fire-belts.

		conditions
			entry CONSULT SOIL
			object LITTERATURE within PLAYER error MSG74
		actions
			message The soil in equatorial countries has distinct properties compared to more moderate tempered areas of the world. Generally, the ground is less moist, even deep down. Thus, there is always a risk of drying out wells if planting too densely on the surface. Trees in equatorial countries spread their roots very deep - often more than 30 metres - to be able to survive at all.

	event GB3
		conditions
			entry CONSULT FIREBELTS
			object LITTERATURE within PLAYER error MSG74
		actions
			message It is very important to remember to protect a plantation against accidents such as fires. When foresting land in equatorial countries, fire belts with a frequency of one for each 400 ha. is a good idea.
